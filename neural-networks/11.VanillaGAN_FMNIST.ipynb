        "While training a GAN, the generator tries to generate new fake data from a given noisy sample space. And with each iteration, it tries to generate more and more realistic data.\n",
        "\n",
        "At the same time, the discriminator tries to differentiate the real data from the generated fake data of the generator. While training the discriminator, we provide it with both, the **real data (positive examples)** and the **generated data (negative examples)**. A time will come when the discriminator wonâ€™t be able to tell whether the data is real or fake (generated by the generator). This is the time we stop the training and can successfully use the generator to generate realistic data that resembles the input data.\n",
